# image-processing #

This repo is a collection of image processing techniques I've learned over the years, mostly from a Fourier analysis lens.

`impro_utils.py` is a module script file containing functions that I've found useful in image processing. Much of these can be found in the OpenCV library, but it's always good to know how it all works under the hood :)

`example.ipynb` and `fourier_demo.ipynb` are Jupyter notebook files that apply the functions from `impro_utils.py` to showcase some imaging processing techniques. Example image files, `lena.mat` and `test2.jpg`, are provided.
